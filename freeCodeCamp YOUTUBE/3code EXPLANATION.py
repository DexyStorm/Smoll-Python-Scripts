#You can use Variables for... variables.
#Pretty much self-explanitory.



#You can type character_name = and the name of the character. For example:
character_name = "John"
#You can type character_age = and the age of the character. For example:
character_age = "35"
#When you change the Variables. For example from John to Mike and from 35 to 50,
#it will automatically use the updated variable.




#Numbers do not need a "" and they can be dicimals.
character_age = 35.103894246



#You can do the same with true or false values.
is_male = true
#it is true, because Mike/Tom is male
